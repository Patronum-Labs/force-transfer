This package provides a library contract that helps to force transfer native tokens to contracts that cannot receive value, that do not have the receive function. The package includes the constants related to the **ForceTransfer Singleton**.

## Rationale

The Force transfer contract is a singleton that allows to force the transfer of a native token to addresses without relying on solidity's call feature and uses `self-destruct` to force send the value.

`ForceTransferLib` is a contract to be used by other developers in development to integrate the logic of force sending within their contracts and protocols.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @patronumlabs/force-transfer
```

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `ForceTransferLib` in your Solidity contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@patronumlabs/force-transfer/contracts/ForceTransferLib.sol";

contract MyContract {
  function forceTransferToAddress(address payable recipient) external payable {
    ForceTransferLib.force(recipient, msg.value);
  }
}
```

Constants related to the **ForceTransfer Singleton** are exported as well.

```javascript
import { FORCE_TRANSFER_SINGLETON_CONFIG } from "@patronumlabs/force-transfer/constants.js"

function checkRawTransactionAndDeployer() {
  console.log(FORCE_TRANSFER_SINGLETON_CONFIG.rawTx);
  console.log(FORCE_TRANSFER_SINGLETON_CONFIG.deployerAddress);
}

checkRawTransactionAndDeployer();
```

## Deployment

For deployment of the **ForceTransfer Singleton**, the nick-method is used with a pre-signed rawTx generated by **[@patronumlabs/nick-method](https://github.com/Patronum-Labs/nick-method/tree/main)**, for more information please check **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)**
